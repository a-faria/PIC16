# card swipe counter

Objective: 


Create an Interrupt-based embedded system to implement an event counter.
This event counter is triggered by breaking the beam between LED and the photodiode. 
In this case by swiping a Leap Card between them. The counter is displayed on two 7 Segment LED Display.

# temperature sensor

Objective: 

Create an embedded system to measure temperature and implement Analog to Digital Conversion.
The component LM35 temperature sensor was used to measure the temperature.
The temperature reading is displayed on two 7 Segment LED Display.
